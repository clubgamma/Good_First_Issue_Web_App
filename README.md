## Description
GitHub advises the usage of "good first issue" (GFI) labels to identify issues that are feasible for newcomers to handle in order to speed up beginner onboarding. However, prior research demonstrates the scarcity and inappropriateness of manually classified GFIs, demonstrating the need for automated suggestions. In this project, we propose GFI-Web-app, a proof-of-concept for automatic GFI recommendation in reality (available at https://pending.com). Project administrators can set up GFI-app to find and tag potential GFIs so that beginners can quickly find issues to fix when submitting their first contributions.

## Why GFI

This website is primarily intended for developers who wish to contribute to open source software but are unsure of where or how to begin. This website gives developers filters so they may search and choose issues and repositories based on the programming languages they are most familiar with. Additionally, they have a choice in the issues they choose to address.
