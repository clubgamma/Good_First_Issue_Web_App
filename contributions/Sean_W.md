Hey Fellow Contributors and creators of this repository!

I'd like to mention that I:
* I have read the Code Of Conduct.
* I have followed all the steps of submission properly.

The contributions that I did in this project are as follows:
1. I added a php file in frontend/src/ that contains a function that retrieves the k largest elements from an array.
2. Added .gitignore, so it wouldn't add PHPStorm's files to the repo.
